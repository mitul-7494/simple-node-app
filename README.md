# simple-node-app
this is a node app trying to post data and get data and show it with server side rendering with ejs.with a little help from YOUTUBE [@CoderDost](https://github.com/coderdost)ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡.
tutorial is not exactly for this app i have tried diffrent approches and make this api based node app somewhere releted with my current semester practical student managment system.

in future i will create a upadate and delete operation it's not really complicated as per api, but its not a valid approach to provide every user permision to delete and update options. once admin side panel is ready then those functionality will be added.
